## Implementation Notes

### Development Sequence (Single-View Focus)
1. **Foundation (Tasks 1-6) âœ… COMPLETE**: Core infrastructure, business logic, and enhanced UI
2. **Polish & Window Management (Tasks 7-8)**: Floating window, auto-refresh, and visual polish
3. **Advanced Features (Task 9)**: Accessibility and professional touches
4. **Quality (Tasks 10-12)**: Auto-refresh, error handling, and comprehensive testing

### Parallel Opportunities
- Tasks 2 and 3 can be developed in parallel after Task 1 âœ… COMPLETED
- Tasks 7 and 8 can be developed in parallel after Task 6 âœ… READY
- Tasks 10 and 11 can be developed in parallel after core features complete

### Key Architectural Decisions Validated
- **EventKit Integration**: âœ… Confirmed as the right approach for comprehensive meeting access
- **@Observable Pattern**: âœ… Modern SwiftUI state management working perfectly
- **MVVM Architecture**: âœ… Clean separation of concerns with CalendarManager as business logic layer
- **Test-Driven Development**: âœ… Each task includes comprehensive testing requirements (84 tests passing)
- **Swift 6 Concurrency**: âœ… Full async/await integration with strict concurrency compliance
- **Protocol-Based Design**: âœ… CalendarEventLike protocol enables clean testing and EventKit integration

### Performance Targets
- Launch time: < 1 second
- Memory usage: < 50MB  
- Refresh time: < 500ms
- 60 FPS UI performance

This task breakdown provides a clear implementation path from initial setup to production-ready application, with each task being independently testable and buildable.

## ðŸŽ‰ COMPONENT-BASED ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE (Tasks 1-6 + Component Extraction)

**Status**: Complete component-based architecture with modular, maintainable codebase  
**Testing**: 216 comprehensive tests passing (100% success rate)  
**Architecture**: Component-based MVVM with @Observable CalendarManager + comprehensive component library  
**Next Phase**: Floating Window & Auto-Refresh (Task 7) ready to begin  

### Major Achievements
- âœ… **Complete Calendar Integration**: Full EventKit pipeline from EKEvent â†’ Meeting
- âœ… **Modern Swift Patterns**: @Observable, Swift 6 concurrency, async/await throughout
- âœ… **Component-Based Architecture**: 9 extracted components with clean, focused interfaces
- âœ… **Enhanced Single-View Interface**: Comprehensive meeting display with collapsible sections
- âœ… **Professional Typography**: Monospace system for technical consistency and readability
- âœ… **Smart Interactions**: Hover-revealed actions, intelligent day collapsing
- âœ… **Visual Polish**: Alpha transparency colors, improved spacing, icon alignment
- âœ… **Copy Functionality**: Full copy integration with visual confirmation
- âœ… **Comprehensive State Management**: Handles all authorization states with proper UI feedback
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: Test-driven development with 216 tests covering all functionality
- âœ… **Modular Components**: Each component tested in isolation with rich previews
- âœ… **Developer Experience**: Full Xcode support with SwiftUI Previews for visual development
- âœ… **Join Integration**: One-click meeting join with URL validation and error handling
- âœ… **Window Optimization**: 720Ã—780 default size for optimal meeting capacity
- âœ… **Component Library**: Reusable, maintainable components in Sources/DocketKit/Views/Components/

**Ready for floating window implementation with clean, testable component architecture! ðŸš€**
